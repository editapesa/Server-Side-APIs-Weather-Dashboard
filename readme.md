# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This project involved creating an application for a user to be able to access the local weather in multiple cities. This involved retreiving data from the OpenWeather API, and includes the following criteria.

- A user can enter any city name and receive the weather for the current and following 5 days. That city is then added to the search history. 
- The current weather conditions for the selected city will include the city name, the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
- The UV index will be colored differently according to if it is favorable, moderate, or severe.
- The future 5 day forecast for that city will display the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
- If a city in the search history is selected, the current and future weather conditions will appear again.
